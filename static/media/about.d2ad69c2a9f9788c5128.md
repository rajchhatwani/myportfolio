# Intro

A fourth-year computer engineering student with a diverse set of interests and a passion for innovation. My academic journey has fueled my enthusiasm for several fields, including aerospace, SaaS product development, green energy, and electronics. I’m fascinated by how technology can drive advancements in these areas, and also thinking about it and adding skills to answer my own question, how applying my knowledge will create impactful solutions ?

Alongside my technical skills, I have a little business mindset, constantly thinking about how technology can be leveraged to solve real-world problems and create value. My goal is to blend my engineering expertise with my entrepreneurial spirit to contribute to sustainable and eco-friendly or we can say environmentally conscious projects and drive sustainable growth in the industries I’m passionate about.
